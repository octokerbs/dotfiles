# Select Theme
As Obsidian is configurable in so many ways there are also a very big number of themes to choose from.

I started by selecting the Minimal theme, which is one of the more popular themes with more than 500.000 downloads.

Hereâ€™s how to find and install the Minimal theme:

```
1. Start Obsidian  
2. Go to Settings > Appearance > Themes > Manage  
3. Select the 'Minimal' theme  
4. Click the 'Install and use' button
```
