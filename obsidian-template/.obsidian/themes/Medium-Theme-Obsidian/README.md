# Installation
I haven't uploaded it to Obsidian's official repositories for copyright reasons regarding the sources. This is just a configuration file.\

Steps:
- Clone the repo
- In Obsidian, open settings.
- Go to the Appearance tab
- In the 'Themes' section click the little folder next to you current theme. This will open the folder that contains current themes downloaded in your project.
- Paste the repo in that folder
- Now, next to the little folder in 'Themes', select 'Medium-Theme'.

REMEMBER: You need to have the required fonts installed for this theme to look like Medium.
